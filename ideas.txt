rate each action by its optimality. 
focus more on the optimality of each action
move reduce the number of blocks left to be filled in a row 
less discretized 


bumpiness := difference in height of consecutive columns 
want to reward 

Use human intelligence more?? 

Sample q values from dataset 



Get the game to continue forever 



 
heuristic: what is bumpiness how to evaluate  
- Maybe calculate the number of surfaces it touches 
how many edges the shape touches when fallen


Reward: how many is it touching? 



approximate q learning: what is f1, f2, ...


Approximate local vs global. one F considers local
one f considers global 


combine two views: global and local
	local: width limited view
	global: height limited view
